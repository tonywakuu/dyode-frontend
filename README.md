 ## Assumptions

 * We're using a modern browser. No polyfills or legacy support.
 * We're using a desktop browser. No responsive design or other mobile support.
 * No malicious or mischievous actors. Input validation and sanitization is minimal.
 * We're connected to the web. Client-side libraries are loaded from a CDN.
 * No DB connectivity. All data managed by React.js.
 * No bootstapping. 
 * Serves as boilerplate for scaled representation.
